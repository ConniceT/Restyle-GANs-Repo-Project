Restyle Encoder via Iterative Refinement


Generative modeling is an unsupervised  machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns of input data  and then taking that data to generate new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

GANS is a pair of nueral networks that fight with each other. similar to a counterfier The generator and the discriminator. Similar to a cop and a counterfeiter

we feed the generator input data and it generates both real and fake images.The discriminator then try to evaluate the accuracy of the generator output.

Iteration is at the forefront in this modell where, the generator get beter and better with evaluation of the discriminator.
